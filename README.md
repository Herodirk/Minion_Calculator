Visit https://herodirk.github.io/ for an online manual.<br>
To open the calculator: run this file, run the function start_app()

Current major limitations:<br>
| (Lesser) Soulflow Engines might not be accurate (there seems to be some weird rounding in game)<br>
| Inferno drop chances might be unaccurate (in game Hypixel seem to have higher chances)<br>
| Item prices from AH (like pets and Everburning Flame) have to be updated manually<br>
| Unknown average wool amount from Enchanted Shears<br>
| For offline calculations of mob minions: Hypixel takes 5 actions to spawn in mobs, this calculator does not account for that<br>
| Dyes (Byzantium and Flame) are included in the base drops of their minions, but they should only be there if the player harvests<br>
Lesser limitations are listed on the support discord server,<br>
